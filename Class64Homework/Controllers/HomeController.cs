//Create an application that enabled multiple users to add and complete tasks.
//This application will have the standard login/signup and the home page should only be accessible to logged in users.

//On the home page, there should be a textbox and a button to add a new task.
//Beneath that, there should be a table with all the current outstanding(incomplete) tasks.

//If a given task has not been started by anyone yet, there should be a button next to the task(on the table) that says "I'm doing this one".
//When clicked, the button should change to "I'm done", however, only for THAT user.
//All other users should see a disabled button that says "{name of user} is doing this". 

//When the user that chose a task clicks on the "I'm done" button, that task should disappear from the table, for ALL users.

//(Use Entity Framework and SignalR)
